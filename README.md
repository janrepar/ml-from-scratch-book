# Machine Learning from Scratch: Ordinary Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of machine learning algorithms built from scratch. The project follows the curriculum of the online book **"Machine Learning from Scratch"** by Daniel Friedman.

The primary objective is to gain a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations and algorithmic construction of ML models by implementing them without relying on high-level abstractions for the core logic.

## Current Focus
**Chapter 1: Ordinary Linear Regression**
Reference: 
- [Construction of OLS](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/c1/construction.html)
- [Code Implementation](https://dafriedman97.github.io/mlbook/content/c1/code.html)

This module focuses on:
- Deriving the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator.
- Implementing the closed-form solution using matrix operations.
- Analyzing the relationship between variables.
- Structuring the algorithm as a reusable Python class with standard methods (e.g., `fit`, `predict`).
